Lissotriton vulgaris (w Europe to w Russia) Smooth newt
Salamandrella keyserlingi (cent Russia to far-east) Siberian salamander

Salamandridae: fully opisthocoelous & SNF exiting posterior to tranverse proc in all verts but T1, with 2 SNF
	Notophthalmus differs from Taricha in having convex or linear (vs concave) inter-prezygapophyseal neural arch margins
		N viridescnes is unique in having hihgly convex inter-prezygapophyseal neural arch margin
		
Plethodontid atlantes: paired articular facets on odontoid process
Ambystoma atlantes: non-faceted odontoid process with wide space to condyles

Hydromantes: long, cylindrical transverse processes
Batrachoseps: transverse processes with distinct angle along their length


Pyron 2014 Sys Bio:
DECj model preferred over DEC model:
"In contrast to the Gondwanan Cradle evident in the caecilians, the MRCA of salamanders is reconstructed in a Laurasian Cradle (Nearctic + Eastern Palearctic) approximately 209 Ma, again reinforcing a Pangaean origin of early amphibian lineages. Stemgroup salamanders are known from the Eastern Palearctic and Nearctic in the Jurassic"
"In contrast, the divergence between the Palearctic and Nearctic cryptobranchids (Andrias and Cryptobranchus) dates to approximately 43 Ma, similar to previous studies"

"The dicamptodontids are Nearctic, 
whereas the ambystomatids are primarily Nearctic with a recent (presumably overland) expansion into the margins of Tropical Middle America, approximately 10 Ma. 
Divergence between the Nearctic dicamptodontid + ambystomatid clade and the primarily Palearctic salamandrids (Salamandroidea) is also consistent with a vicariant origin while Laurasia was fragmenting. 
The salamandrids show movement between the Western and Eastern Palearctic and the Eastern Palearctic and Southeast Asia frequently throughout the Cenozoic, presumably"
